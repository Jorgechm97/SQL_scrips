# SQL Queries Generation

In this repository, you will find SQL queries created to meet specific requirements using SQL language and putting into practice the knowledge acquired about database queries.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to apply SQL concepts and execute SQL statements to meet specific requirements in creating and manipulating databases.

## Development

### Initial Steps
1. Use the entity-relationship design, table creation script, and example data table (Excel file) published on the course platform as the working base.
2. Use Microsoft SQL Express as the DBMS.

### Generated SQL Queries
1. **Delete and Load Data:**
   - Generate SQL commands to delete all data from tables and load data according to the entity-relationship diagram and the example data table.

2. **Invoice Details Query:**
   - Create an SQL query that shows all invoices with their respective details, including information such as invoice number, issuance date, associated customer, associated employee, total to pay, invoice status, and purchased products with quantities and prices.

3. **Total Sales per Store:**
   - Generate an SQL query showing the total sales per store, displaying the store name, total sales (sum of total to pay), and number of issued invoices.

4. **Customers with More than Two Purchases:**
   - Create an SQL query that displays the name of customers, the number of purchases made, and the total amount paid for those purchases, for customers who have made more than two purchases.

5. **Update Delivery Date:**
   - Generate an SQL command that updates the estimated delivery date of products to three additional days from the current date, for products where the difference between the delivery date and issuance date is less than four days.

## Usage Instructions
- Use the provided SQL queries with Microsoft SQL Express software and the existing database according to the design and sample data.
